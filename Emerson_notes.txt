Improvements:
    vote number
    how to add a image if needed?
(suggestion) Implement template for all the pages
How to go back from Submit new question to home page or list?
(to correct) everytime we delete 1 question, the change is shown only when we restart the server
We need more descriptive function names
We need some way of rehashing question and answer IDs - it cannot be related to the length of the list, as this will always change - in reality we should be creating a unique ID for each
We seem to have the same piece of code (writing the rows) a lot of times in CRUD
_____________________
Improvements from the review with the guys:

add-question -> to not use dictionary
edit question -> use CRUD.update
CRUD -> rewrite all the writer functions
CRUD.delete -> We should use the writer function here instead of duplicating code


Done:
(fixed) There's a defect in the answers input -> It only shows up when we rerun the server
(done) When adding a question: submission time
(done) When adding a question: view number?
